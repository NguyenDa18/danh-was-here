Apologies for the lack of posts lately -needless to say I've been busy or was resting.

During the time I am writing this, America is portrayed in chaos, rightfully so. What really hits hard are the Portland protests at the Justice Center, and the chilling response of the federal government taking protesters in unmarked vans, and causing serious and needless injuries. All of this after practically 5 months of COVID-19 clouding the country in confusion, suspicion, and trepidation.

I have kept a faded copy of TIME magazine on my shelf for 2 years now and that is because of one entry that really soothed my heart whenever I needed a dose of hope again: "American Like Me" by Viet Thanh Nguyen. 

The following are parts I highlighted that I keep to my heart today, as an American child with immigrant parents.

"If we love our countries, we owe it to them not just to flatter them but to tell the truth about them in all their beauty and their brutality. America included."



"I could never be a writer \[in Vietnam] and say the things I say without being sent to prison. So I choose the freedom of America, even at a time when "love it or leave it" is no longer just rhetorical."



"I never said "I love you" when I was growing up because my parents never said "I love you" to me. That does not mean they did not love me. They loved me so much that they worked themselves to exhaustion in their new America...The memory of that visceral love, expressed in sacrifice, is in the marrow of my bones."



"Some Vietnamese Americans would tell me I was not really Vietnamese because I did not speak perfect Vietnamese...For me, as long as I feel Vietnamese, as long as Vietnamese things move me, I am still Vietnamese."



"Is it not more important that I love the substance behind those symbols rather than the symbols themselves? The principles. Democracy, equality, justice, hope, peace and especially freedom, the freedom to write and to think whatever I want, even if my freedoms and the beauty of those principles have been nurtured by the blood of genocide, slavery, conquest, colonization, imperial war, forever war. All of that is America, our beautiful and brutal America."
